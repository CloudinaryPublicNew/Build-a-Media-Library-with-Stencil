## Get Setup

Stencilâ€™s installation is simple. You can clone a starter template from GitHub and install the npm dependencies. No major configuration, just clone, install and run.

Clone the repository from GitHub to your machine:

```
# Clone starter
git clone https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-starter.git todo
```

Install the dependencies:

```
# Enter the cloned project
cd todo

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

You can start the app at port 3333 using the following command:

```
npm start
```

All our component code will be written in `src/components`. You can ignore the `my-name` starter component, since we will remove it from the face of the project.
