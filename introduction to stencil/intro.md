## Overview 

In this code lab, you'll learn about Stencil - a new compiler for composing user interfaces using pure custom components. Stencil enables you to build components using new, cutting-edge technologies, such as TypeScript and JSX, then generates a pure custom component that can be used anywhere supported. In essence, you can import a Stencil generated component into React, Angular, Vue, e.t.c.
